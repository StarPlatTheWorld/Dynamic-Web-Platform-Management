# Dynamic-Web-Platform-Management

Dynamic Web Platform Management project from community college. We were given resources and were required to make a website based on the content we received for a spa. This site utilizes a lot of images and some css (mainly bootstrap pulled from external source), but it isn't overly optimized for loading time which makes it not user friendly.
